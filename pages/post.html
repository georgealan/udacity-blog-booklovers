                <p>
                    In the article below I explain the process I used to develop the blog, a summary containing tips on 
                    tools I use and other details. To start the project for this blog, I organized several topics that I like to choose one. In this case, 
                    I am an avid reader and enjoy reading a lot, so I decided to create a blog about reading experiences.

            <h2 id="subtitle-1">How did I come up with the idea for the blog's theme?</h2>
            <p>
                Users can write their opinions about the books they have read so that other readers can see their reviews 
                and decide whether or not it is worth reading.
                This approach of creating a list of things that you are interested in is very helpful in unlocking ideas 
                for creating projects from scratch, such as websites, applications, and systems. After deciding on the 
                theme, I needed to organize a workflow. For this particular project, I decided to create a layout design 
                from scratch without using templates downloaded from the internet. I had to incorporate design stages 
                into the project.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle-2">Dividing the project into stages</h2>
            <p>
                To make it easier to create the blog layout and avoid being overwhelmed with so many design options 
                available (a major obstacle that blocks creativity is having too many options available), I divided the 
                design stage as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Research for references, inspiration</li>
                <li>Information organization</li>
                <li>Wireframe</li>
                <li>Collecting/creating assets, images, illustrations, icons</li>
                <li>High-fidelity prototype</li>
                <li>Image treatment/optimization</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With this division, it became easier to start the project. I will provide a brief explanation of 
                each stage in the next topic, see.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle-3">Research for references, inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                To make the life of every designer, whether amateur or professional, easier and more productive, it is 
                always good to look for visual references to stimulate your imagination. I believe that all artists, 
                including the best in the world, always gather reference material to aid in the production of their work. 
                Drawers need real photos to create compositions of their drawings. Without a vast visual repertoire, your 
                creativity is limited, and you need a lot of variety.
                <br><br>
                I use these sites to collect interface design references, but they have everything, including general 
                graphic design:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">Behance</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.awwwards.com/" target="_blank">Awwwards</a></li>
            </ul>
            <figure>
                <img src="../assets/images/img-article-01.png" alt="Behance website screenshot">
                <figcaption>Behance website browser screenshot</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Take some time out of your day to look at the projects that interest you the most visually, search by theme. 
                In my case, I searched a lot for bookstores and people reading to obtain the most common visual references 
                used in sites with this theme, including color palettes. By doing this every day, your visual repertoire 
                will become much richer, and your imagination will be better in your future projects.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle-4">Organizing the Information</h2>
            <p>
                This step is important so that you have an idea of what content needs to be included on the site. If you 
                don't have an idea of what to put on the site, you can't create the design. Before starting to build the 
                structure in the wireframe, you need to decide what you will put on the site. For this, you can create a 
                mind map with the idea of the main topics you want. For this blog, I organized the content as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recent articles</li>
                <li>Highest rated writers</li>
                <li>Articles about comics</li>
                <li>Articles about technical books</li>
                <li>Articles about literary books</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Since the scope of the theme is related to books, I thought about dividing related subjects such as writers, 
                comics, textbooks, and so on. This helped me think about which sections I needed to add to the site. With 
                the use of a mind mapping tool, you can expand your theme and narrow down each topic more deeply and 
                discover what you need to add to your site.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../assets/images/img-article-02.png" alt="Mindmap browser screenshot">
                <figcaption>Mindmap website browser screenshot</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Without content to show, you won't be able to create a design. Even if the design is fake, with fake 
                content, this step is essential for you to be able to draw your interface with better quality. This 
                step is for getting a glimpse of the content blocks you'll need to add to the site. It's not the step 
                for creating the actual content itself. Here, it would be a content wireframe, serving to reserve space 
                in the design to receive the final actual content at the end of the design process.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle-5">Wireframe Stage</h2>
            <p>
                With the organization of the blog content in hand, I started creating the wireframe. This stage is only 
                for organizing the visual elements of the site, and we don't use colors or images to build the structure. 
                We only draw the blocks where the information will be displayed and distribute elements on the screen to 
                understand how to structure the layout.
                It's meant to be an experimental stage, a draft of the final layout, without worrying about colors or 
                images. Here, you're free to explore the full potential of the organization of the content you 
                want to display.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Balsamiq Wireframe software screenshot</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                A tool that I use and like is <a href="https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/" target="_blank">Balsamiq Wireframe</a> It's a 
                very practical tool, it has several pre-built blocks that just need to be dragged onto the canvas, saving 
                a lot of time. But you can do the same work in various other software such as Illustrator, Photoshop, 
                or even directly in Figma, Adobe XD, the choice is yours.
                Prototyping in wireframe is very helpful, you can test your ideas in a practical and fast way without 
                wasting time with more complicated design elements like colors and typography that will come in the next step.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle-6">Researching references, resources, and images</h2>
            <p>
                As we create the wireframe, we begin to imagine and visualize mentally how our layout will look. For those 
                with a vivid imagination, you know what I'm talking about; it's like reading a book and mentally visualizing 
                all the scenes while reading. This happens to me when I'm designing layouts.
                Once we are satisfied with the wireframe, we can start looking for the assets, images, and icons we will 
                need for the layout. You will know what you need because you visualized your design mentally and have 
                some idea of what to look for. I recommend these sites for downloading free and copyright-free images, 
                icons, and videos: 
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li><a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a></li>

                <li><a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Collect everything you need so that you have everything you need for the next phase of the project, the 
                creation of the high-fidelity prototype.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle-7">High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
            <p>
                This is the final stage of the design phase, where we need to polish the design and make it faithful to 
                the final product. I can't give you all the details here because the process is more detailed, it's 
                interesting to study UI design or even graphic design to have a basic understanding of the whole process. 
                I am an amateur in design, I identify a lot with this area because I really like art and drawing, I 
                used to draw a lot in my childhood and adolescence but I stopped to focus on programming, and I never 
                got to study design in depth, I'm just an enthusiast, I started studying recently to be able to create 
                more attractive interfaces on my own without needing to download templates.
                <br><br>
                What I did in this stage was to choose a typography font family that ended up being 
                <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova" target="_blank">Proxima Nova</a> what criteria did I use to choose it? 
                I found it beautiful, kkkkk. I tested visualizing some texts with other fonts and it won. A useful tool 
                that I use here on my Windows system is <a href="https://fontba.se/" target="_blank">FontBase</a> a typography font manager, 
                it helps a lot to visually compare various fonts and decide which one to use for your work.
                <br><br>
                To choose colors I used a monochromatic palette, I chose a primary color and changed the saturation and 
                lightness with the HLS color system see more details about this color scheme here: 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl" target="_blank">HSL Article</a> To avoid 
                confusion in creating complex color palettes I decided to use a monochromatic one because it's simpler 
                to work with. I recommend reading this book: Practical UI by Adham Dannaway he explains the main topics 
                in a practical and quick way, it's great for learning the basics quickly and start creating things without 
                wasting time, I really liked this book. At the end of the article, I'll leave several references for 
                materials that I recommend.
                <br><br>
                A tool that helps me collect colors is color pickers, many times when I'm looking at references I'm 
                interested in a color so I use software to capture the desired color on the screen, I use 
                <a href="https://annystudio.com/software/colorpicker/" target="_blank">Just Color Picker</a> for Windows and for Mac 
                I think the best one is <a href="https://colorslurp.com/" target="_blank">ColorSlurp</a>
                <br><br>
                As I said, I've been a design enthusiast since I was young, I've been using Photoshop since version CS2, 
                CS5, Fireworks, and so on. I say this because you will need to manipulate some images in graphic software 
                like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator so that your images look the way you want. Figma has some editing tools, 
                but it's not comparable to Photoshop, where you can compose, paint, manipulate images, and make your website 
                even more beautiful.
                <br><br>
                During the creation of the high-fidelity prototype, you will need to work with images, icons, and illustrations, 
                I use Photoshop and Illustrator a lot to help me with images, I use Illustrator to create vectors and when 
                I need to create SVGs of icons and logos and some vector illustrations. And the most important thing I 
                explain in the following topic.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle-8">Image Treatment and Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                Optimizing images is mandatory for the web. If you don't take the care to optimize the size of your 
                images and put them on your website without checking their size, your site will become heavy and slow. 
                But you can argue that reducing the size of images makes them lose quality and look ugly with low resolution. 
                However, there are excellent tools on the market capable of reducing the size of images by up to 70% without 
                losing the quality of the original. The results are amazing.
                <br><br>
                Here, I use a Photoshop plugin called <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a>. It compresses images in 
                two formats, PNG and JPG, and the compression is sensational. Files of 4mb can end up being 180kb without 
                losing visible quality. This tool also has an online version. If I were to do this process manually 
                without a plugin in Photoshop, the image would lose quality because the process of saving images in 
                Photoshop in its pure form damages the image. These plugins are specialized in compressing images without 
                losing quality, and they are an essential tool for the work of a web designer. There are other tools of 
                this type, and I leave here the link to others that I know:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://trimage.org/" target="_blank">Trimage</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://pngquant.org/" target="_blank">PNGQuant</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Today, with the advent of artificial intelligence, software has emerged that does the opposite. They 
                increase the resolution of images with low resolution. If you have bad images with low resolution that 
                you need to use in your work and can't find another one of better quality to replace them, you can use 
                software that increases the resolution scale of images and recovers losses. What I use a lot here are the 
                Topaz Labs software, specifically <a href="https://www.topazlabs.com/gigapixel-ai" target="_blank">Topaz Gigapixel AI</a>. 
                It is fantastic and capable of restoring photos perfectly. It is very useful for recovering unique images 
                with low quality.
                <br><br>
                Another tool I use here is <a href="https://pt.vectormagic.com/" target="_blank">Vector Magic</a>, which you can use to 
                quickly convert PNG and JPG images into EPS and SVG vectors with exceptional results. It is very useful 
                for cases where you draw an icon or logo and need the SVG file but don't want to spend time in Illustrator 
                outlining the path to create the vector. With this software, you take a picture of your drawing and throw 
                it into the software, which rasterizes it for you automatically and with quality. It is one of the best 
                in the market in this regard. These tools help a lot in the creative process, both to improve visual 
                quality and to speed up the workflow. After finishing the high-fidelity prototype, we can move on to the 
                coding stage.

            <p>
                In this project, due to the approaching delivery date, I did not wait to finish the Figma prototype before 
                starting to code, and I had to give up some features I wanted to put on the blog otherwise I would not be 
                able to deliver the project on time. Since I already had the project in my head, and it is not complex, 
                I decided to code before the design was finalized.

            <p>
                Here, as I am traveling in both worlds, design and front-end, I thought of an appropriate structure divided 
                into blocks from the beginning of the project. Some designers create extravagant things in the layout, and 
                the front-end professional has to spend hours thinking to figure out how to pass the extravagance of the 
                design to the code. But being the creator yourself makes everything simpler.
                <br><br>
                The first thing I do is structure the code blocks by dividing them into sections, and with that, I insert 
                the contents, create the CSS styles. In the case of this project, I did not use separate CSS files for 
                components, which makes development much easier, and the CSS files are smaller, and everything is more 
                comfortable to understand. I will use this approach from now on.
                <br><br>
                For this project, I chose to use CSS Grid to build the layout. My design was all based on grids of 12 
                columns for desktop, 8 columns for tablet, and 4 columns for mobile. With the Grid, everything became 
                simpler to fit in the HTML.

                In summary, that's it. In the next topic, I'll leave references to books, software, and tools that I use 
                and like. Thank you for reading this far, and good luck on your projects!
